New Framework: a Schema Driven UI
=================================

<b>A. The demo page:</b>

<b>B. Problem:</b>
In most of "regular" web applications, pages are constructed "concretely" with concrete html tags. For example, there may be many form views to collect data in your app and you normally build individual form view concretely using html tags where you specify a list of fields (a label and an input field) and a submit button/function. When you need another form, you normally recreate (or even clone and modify) another similar form with similar tags. After a while when your app reach certain size, you will see most of you views appear similar or redundant in term of fields (labels and inputs). <br/><br/>
So what is the problem?<br/><br/>
